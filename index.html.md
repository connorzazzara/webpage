<p>project for <a href="http://bev.facey.rocks/"><em>The Bev Facey Computer science class</em></a>.</p>
<h1> Why this was made</h1>
<h2> a short description</h2>
this was made as a project for the<p> <strong> <span style="color:blue">Bev</span> <span style="color:yellow">Facey</span> block 4 computer science class</strong> as a submission for CSE1210: <em>client side scripting 1</em>
<hr />

<h1> How this was made</h1>
this website was made utilizing <strong> HTML </strong>, <strong> HTML </strong> is a type of code that is primarily for making websites and general internet based code, for a better description, you can go <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Examples"><em>here</em></a>,</p> or alternatively, you can watch  <a href = "https://youtu.be/MDLn5-zSQQI"><em> this </em></a>.</p>

<h1> Theory questions </h1>
1. <em>Internet backbone</em> is essentially the connection of <em>networks</em> worldwide, the networks themselves, and what connects the networks.
<br>
<br>
2. A <em>client</em> is some part of computer that allows it to connect to a <em>server</em>, it can be hardware or software.
<br>
<br>
3. Servers are what computers connect to via the internet, for various reasons <em>routers</em>, as the name suggests, reroute the internet into devices in a general area. A <em>switch</em> is what creates a network. a <em>workstation</em> is a computer or device that is connected to the internet that is used for professional application or general application.
<br>
<br>
4. the <em>internet protocol suite</em>, is a networking type that uses <em>IP addresses</em>, which are groups of numbers and letters associated with a device, IPS utilizes different layers of connecting, such as <em>host-to-host connection</em>.
<br><br>
5.
<br> <br>
6. <em>Hypertext</em> is any sort of text on a page that connects directly to another page, utilizing <em>hyperlinks.</em>
<br> <br>
7. The <em>"web"</em> is what connects everything on the internet worldwide, if it had a physical look, it would look like a web encircling the earth.
<br> <br>
8. The <em>hypertext transfer protocol</em> (HTTP) is what connects hypertext and hyperlinks, it also plays a very important part in connections on the web
<br> <br>
9. <em>HTTPS</em> is a secure addition to HTTP, it's basically the same thing, but with more security.
<br> <br>
10. The first stage of websites was known as <em>Web 1.0</em>, it contained very basic systems and its pages were mostly static, it was also very slow. The second stage of websites was <em>Web 2.0</em>, Web 2.0 was faster, and more dynamic. The most recent stage is <em>Web3</em>, Web3 is quite different from its previous versions, as it is mostly used for internet currencies.
<br><br>
11. Web 1.0 was developed when the idea of the internet was first a thing, so people were learning how to use those new developments. Web 2.0 is still used to this day, it was developed long ago, but not as long ago as web 1.0, Web 2.0 introduced videos. Web 3.0 is mostly just used for cryptocurrency and that sort of thing, so it's used less than 2.0, even if it's more recent.
<br><br>
12. <em>Markup languages</em> are used to make websites, such as this one, Markup is decently easy to learn, which is why it's so mainstream, if you want to see an example of markup coding, use google's inspect feature.
<br><br>
13. Markup and <em>scripting languages</em> may look the same, but they're fairly different, markup is simpler and requires more full words, and scripting has more pre-defined commands.
<br><br>
14.
<br><br>
15. The best thing about making this website, is that i only have experience with <em>python</em>, and that was just recent, so i was essentially going in blind. even if i have had precious experiences with computers,due to having one at home, i've never used markdown or <em>css</em> before, so this was a learning experience, and i believe this is something others should learn.
<br><br>
16. Since I plan to go into <em>IT</em> in the future, i'll need to know how websites work so i can fix issues someone may have, in addition, i might need to make my own website if i choose to become a freelancer.
